# 3d-printers of SFCI
The STUDIO for Creative Inquiry currently has 2 operational FDM 3D printers. Access to the printers is granted by STUDIO staff with explicit permission. 

| Printer | Material | filament size |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| [Prusa i3 MK3](#Prusa-i3-MK3) | PLA | 1.75mm |
| [Ultimaker 2 Extended+](#ultimaker-2) | PLA | 2.85mm |

## Loading and Unloading Filament
### Loading
The Prusa should be in `Autoload` mode at all times meaning all you have to do to load new filament in the machine is hand-guide filament through the hotend until you hear a beep.  

This prompts the hotend to heat and ask what kind of filament you would like to use. Please select:

| Material | Bedtemp |Nozzle |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| PLA | 60F | 200F |

When the printer beeps next it will be at this temp and you can guide new filament through until it comes out of the nozzle in the correct colord
### Unloading

Clicking the dial in and going to `Unload` should take us to the same temperature setting menu we saw earlier, this time heating up to release melted filament in the hotend. 

Upon the next beep, the hotend will be 200F and the servos will spin in the upward direction to push filament back out of the top of the machine.

## ⚠ Troubleshooting ⚠
### Clogs
Clogs can take many shapes and forms.The most common symptom of a clog is that filament pushed through the top of the hotend while 'loading filament' does not back it through the nozzle. If the path of the filament is blocked there are a few steps we can take to resolve this. 
1. Heat the nozzle manually to 240F 
2. Take one of the `declogging needles` and slowly insert into the hotend from the bottom of the Prusa's nozzle
3. Repeatedly jam the needle in and out of the nozzle until the needle passes through the clog, breaking it up, or filament stuck in the lower part of the nozzle seeps out. 

the above nozzle works best for small clogs that block a tiny part of the hotend canal
